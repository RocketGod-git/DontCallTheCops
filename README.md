IR strobe that blinks at 14hz
Don't call this thing a MIRT because it isn't one. It's just an IR strobe that happends to blink at 14hz. Due To the limitations to the 555 I was not able to consistently build a circuit to produce a 14hz strobe. Version 2 uses an ATTINY85 and the scematic can be found in the link below.
